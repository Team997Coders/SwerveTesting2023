# Swerve Drive Command Framework and Tester
Using the information from 3 difference project including:
- mSwerveModuleControl: My basic modules initialization project
- pesto: the 2023 robot from Flaming Chickens
- swervecontrollercommand: Example from 2023 WPILIB
- BasedNeoSwerve: Sushi Squad robot exaple link from Flaming Chickens Swerve presentation

I hacked (copied and pasted) from pieces of each of these project to come up with the basic code to control 1 of our swerve drive modules.

I neeed to move this to a command based project so that I can add buttons to the smartdashboard to reset the encoders and then to move the module to a set angle.
